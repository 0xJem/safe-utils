## safe-utils

Interact with the [Safe API](https://docs.safe.global/sdk/api-kit) from Foundry scripts.

### Installation

```bash
forge install Recon-Fuzz/safe-utils
```

### Usage

#### 1. Import the library

```solidity
import {Safe} from "safe-utils/Safe.sol";
```

#### 2. Initialize the client

Build the client by passing your safe address.

```solidity
using Safe for *;

Safe.Client safe;

function setUp() public {
  safe.initialize(safeAddress);
}
```

#### 3. Propose transactions

```solidity
safe.proposeTransaction(weth, abi.encodeCall(IWETH.withdraw, (0)), sender);
```

If you are using ledger, make sure to pass the derivation path as the last argument:

```solidity
safe.proposeTransaction(weth, abi.encodeCall(IWETH.withdraw, (0)), sender, "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0");
```

Proposing a transaction/transactions using a Ledger will also require pre-computing the signature, due to a (current) limitation with forge.

The first step is to pre-compute the signature:

```solidity
bytes memory signature = safe.sign(weth, abi.encodeCall(IWETH.withdraw, (0)), Enum.Operation.Call, sender, "m/44'/60'/0'/0/0");
```

Note that this call will fail if `forge script` is called with the `--ledger` flag, as that would block this library's contracts from utilising the same device. Instead, pass the Ledger derivation path as an argument to the script.

The second step is to take the value for the returned `bytes` and provide them when proposing the transaction:

```solidity
safe.proposeTransactionWithSignature(weth, abi.encodeCall(IWETH.withdraw, (0)), sender, signature);
```

### Requirements

- Foundry with FFI enabled:
  - Pass `--ffi` to your commands (e.g. `forge test --ffi`)
  - Or set `ffi = true` in your `foundry.toml`

```toml
[profile.default]
ffi = true
```

- All `Recon-Fuzz/solidity-http` dependencies
